                 In this global pandemic, not only humans, but also animals have been affected by COVID-19.
                 Majority of humans could easily protect themselves by maintaining social distancing 
                 and keeping themselves and their surroundings hygenic using handwash and soaps. However,
                 it makes life difficult for animals such as dogs and cats. They have to depend upon 
                 humans to throw left over foods, from which they will fulfill their hunger. Luckily, Bikash Sahoo 
                 and his friends have made a huge initiative by feeding food to street dogs, cats and cows.
                 And with the kind donation of few people, their campaign has grown steadily in this time of crisis.
                 It's a humble request to all of you to give some donation to the site.
                 The contact name and bank details are given below. Thank you!
